                                Disease dataset as CSV file (training and test datasets)


This article seeks to develop a resilient machine learning model capable of accurately predicting human diseases by efficiently analyzing the symptoms exhibited by individuals.

In this project, we have established a well-structured pipeline to execute each step or phase separately, allowing us to concentrate more effectively on each individual stage. The pipeline attached below :

<br>
<br>
In the initial step, we work with two distinct datasets: one for training and another for testing. In this phase, we analyze the training data in the CSV files using Matplotlib libraries. Subsequently, we proceed with data modification to ensure cleanliness and readiness for processing, ultimately enabling accurate predictions. The number patients in training dataset is 4921, and for test is 43.

<mark> There are 133 columns in the training dataset that all of them have filled with 0 / 1 values except `target label` filled by string values like AIDS, Diabets, Cancer and so on.</mark>
